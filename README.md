#### 3. User Interface Overview:
Main Components of the VS Code User Interface:

1. Activity Bar:
   - Located on the left side, it allows me to switch between views like Explorer, Search, Source Control, Run, and Extensions.

2. Side Bar:
   - Displays different views and panels depending on the activity selected (e.g., file explorer, search results, source control information).

3. Editor Group:
   - The main area where I edit my files. I can split this into multiple editor groups for side-by-side editing.

4.Status Bar:
   - Located at the bottom, it provides information about the current file, such as language, encoding, line endings, and also displays error and warning counts.

#### 4. Command Palette:
What is the Command Palette and How to Access It:

- The Command Palette is a powerful tool that allows me to access various commands and settings in VS Code.

4. Start Debugging:
   - I click the green play button in the Run view or press `F5`.

Key Debugging Features:

- Breakpoints, watch variables, call stack, and step through code.

#### 10. Using Source Control:
How to Integrate Git with VS Code for Version Control:

1. Initialize a Repository:
